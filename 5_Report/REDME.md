# Digital Clock Alarm 

# Introduction
A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally that is  in numerals or other symbols, as opposed to an analogue clock. Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism.

They are designed to make a signal / alarm at a specific time. The use of digital alarm clocks has increased over years with development in electronics. The advantage of digital alarm clocks over analogue alarm clocks is that they require less power, the time can be set or reset easily and displays the time in digit.

# Objective of Project
The objective of this project is to design and build a digital clock.The clock is designed to show the hour, minute, second, am and pm functionusing LCD display panel. The clock design must have other alternative devices.An alarm circuit is also connected to facilitate the alarm command which will be produced by an alarm buzzer.
# Basic Requirements
The Following are the total Requirements to built Digital Clock Alarm,
* Hardware Components
* Software
* Embedded C Programming
# ATmega328 Micro-Controller
The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.

The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software-selectable power-saving modes. The device operates between 1.8 and 5.5 volts. The device achieves throughput approaching 1 MIPS/MHz.
