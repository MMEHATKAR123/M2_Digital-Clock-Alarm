# Digital Clock Alarm 

# Introduction
A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally that is  in numerals or other symbols, as opposed to an analogue clock. Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism.

They are designed to make a signal / alarm at a specific time. The use of digital alarm clocks has increased over years with development in electronics. The advantage of digital alarm clocks over analogue alarm clocks is that they require less power, the time can be set or reset easily and displays the time in digit.

# Objective of Project
The objective of this project is to design and build a digital clock.The clock is designed to show the hour, minute, second, am and pm functionusing LCD display panel. The clock design must have other alternative devices.An alarm circuit is also connected to facilitate the alarm command which will be produced by an alarm buzzer.
