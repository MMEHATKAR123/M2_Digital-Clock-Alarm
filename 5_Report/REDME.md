# Digital Clock Alarm 

# Introduction
A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally that is  in numerals or other symbols, as opposed to an analogue clock. Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism.

They are designed to make a signal / alarm at a specific time. The use of digital alarm clocks has increased over years with development in electronics. The advantage of digital alarm clocks over analogue alarm clocks is that they require less power, the time can be set or reset easily and displays the time in digit.

# Objective of Project
The objective of this project is to design and build a digital clock.The clock is designed to show the hour, minute, second, am and pm functionusing LCD display panel. The clock design must have other alternative devices.An alarm circuit is also connected to facilitate the alarm command which will be produced by an alarm buzzer.
# Basic Requirements
The Following are the total Requirements to built Digital Clock Alarm,
* Hardware Components
* Software
* Embedded C Programming
# ATmega328 Micro-Controller
The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.

The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software-selectable power-saving modes. The device operates between 1.8 and 5.5 volts. The device achieves throughput approaching 1 MIPS/MHz.
  ## ATmega328 Micro-Controller Pin Description
The Atmega328 is a very popular microcontroller chip produced by Atmel. It is an 8-bit microcontroller that has 32K of flash memory, 1K of EEPROM, and 2K of internal SRAM.

The Atmega328 is one of the microcontroller chips that are used with the popular Arduino Duemilanove boards. The Arduino Duemilanove board comes with either 1 of 2 microcontroller chips, the Atmega168 or the Atmega328. Of these 2, the Atmega328 is the upgraded, more advanced chip. Unlike the Atmega168 which has 16K of flash program memory and 512 bytes of internal SRAM, the Atmega328 has 32K of flash program memory and 2K of Internal SRAM.
## Applications of ATmega328
The following are the applications of atmega328 microcontroller,
* A complete package including ATmega 328 and Arduino can be used in several different real-life applications.
* It can be used in Embedded Systems Projects.
* It can also be used in robotics.
* Quad-copter and even small aero-plane can also be designed through it.
* Power monitoring and management systems can also be prepared using this device.
* I have designed this Home Security System using Arduino UNO, you should have a look at it.
# Software
The software manages various hardware devices and systems. The basic idea behind embedded systems software is to control the functioning of a set of hardware devices without compromising on the purpose or the efficiency. Embedded systems software can be compared to the operating systems in computers.
## SimulIDE
SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with simple electronic circuits and microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.This is not an accurate simulator for circuit analysis, it aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, this means simple and not very accurate electronic models and limited features.
