# ATmega328 Micro-Controller
The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.

The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software-selectable power-saving modes. The device operates between 1.8 and 5.5 volts. The device achieves throughput approaching 1 MIPS/MHz.

[11:38 AM, 4/23/2022] áºžuÃŸhmÃ¤ ReddyðŸ’®: ## ATmega328 Micro-Controller Pin Description
The Atmega328 is a very popular microcontroller chip produced by Atmel. It is an 8-bit microcontroller that has 32K of flash memory, 1K of EEPROM, and 2K of internal SRAM.

The Atmega328 is one of the microcontroller chips that are used with the popular Arduino Duemilanove boards. The Arduino Duemilanove board comes with either 1 of 2 microcontroller chips, the Atmega168 or the Atmega328. Of these 2, the Atmega328 is the upgraded, more advanced chip. Unlike the Atmega168 which has 16K of flash program memory and 512 bytes of internal SRAM, the Atmega328 has 32K of flash program memory and 2K of Internal SRAM.

The Atmega328 has 28 pins.

It has 14 digital I/O pins, of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs and 6 analog input pins. These I/O pins account for 20 of the pins.
