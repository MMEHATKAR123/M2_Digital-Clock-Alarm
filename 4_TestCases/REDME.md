## SimulIDE
SimulIDE is a simple real time electronic circuit simulator, intended for hobbyist or students to learn and experiment with simple electronic circuits and microcontrollers, supporting PIC, AVR and Arduino.This is not an accurate simulator for circuit analysis, it aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, this means simple and not very accurate electronic models and limited features.

You can create, simulate and interact with your circuits within minutes, just drag components from the list, drop into the circuit, connect them and push power button to see how it works.
