## Embedded C Language
Embedded C is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the C Standards Committee to address commonality issues that exist between C extensions for different embedded systems.

Embedded C programming typically requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to support enhanced microprocessor features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations. The C Standards Committee produced a Technical Report, most recently revised in 2008 and reviewed in 2013,providing a common standard for all implementations to adhere to. It includes a number of features not available in normal C, such as fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces and basic I/O hardware addressing. Embedded C uses most of the syntax and semantics of standard C, e.g., main() function, variable definition, datatype declaration, conditional statements (if, switch case), loops (while, for), functions, arrays and strings, structures and union, bit operations, macros, etc.
# Desired Features of software
* Reader Master – Should allow editing of various access points and their interface details viz. IP address, Unit ID, Com Port.
* Employee Master - Allows editing of employee details, like name, employee
number, shift, access zones.

* Card Personaliser / Finger Encoding (option): Allows Mifare card/ Finger print encoding based on the employee master information. Needs externally connected personaliser.
* Offline Data Gathering – Periodically polls all the connected readers for swipe data and displays with user photograph if available. Data is available in near real-time(within 30 seconds).
* Headcount – Zonewise presence of employees is available. Alternately employee can be tracked within a zone.
* Clock Data Editing - Allows editing of the time data (by administrators with time data edit permission).
* Database : MYSQL
* Export Function - Export function can be used to export data to a CSV file.
* Time Synchronization - Time can be synchronized of all the connected readers on a
periodic basis.
* Large Data -Upto 10Gb data can be stored in the current tables. Older data is moved
to archives. Instantaneous Reports are available on the current table data.
* Easy of Operation: User can group different readers and employees. Different actions can be applied to selected group of readers or employees.
  * Installation & commissioning -
Installation & commissioning will be completely done by supplier and All
installation related works like electrification,casing-caping & routing of cables as per requirements, carpentry & civil work has been done by supplier with no any extra cost supplier must do arrangement of required material & items for completion of this work.
